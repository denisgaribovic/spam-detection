## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a spam detection system using the Naive Bayes algorithm in Python. The system is designed to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam).

## Business Use Case

In today's digital age, businesses and individuals alike face the constant threat of spam emails, which can range from annoying advertisements to dangerous phishing attempts. Spam not only clutters inboxes but can also lead to significant financial losses and data breaches.

By implementing an effective spam detection system:

- Businesses can protect sensitive information, reduce the risk of security breaches, and maintain a clean communication channel.
- Individuals can enjoy a clutter-free inbox, saving time and avoiding potential scams.

This project aims to provide a robust, easy-to-integrate solution that can be customized for different environments, helping users to stay safe and efficient.
