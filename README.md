## Business Use Case

In today's digital age, businesses and individuals alike face the constant threat of spam emails, which can range from annoying advertisements to dangerous phishing attempts. Spam not only clutters inboxes but can also lead to significant financial losses and data breaches.

By implementing an effective spam detection system:

- Businesses can protect sensitive information, reduce the risk of security breaches, and maintain a clean communication channel.
- Individuals can enjoy a clutter-free inbox, saving time and avoiding potential scams.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a practical and easy-to-integrate spam detection system that can be customized for different needs. Using the Naive Bayes algorithm and Python, the system will sort emails into "spam" or "ham" (non-spam), helping users stay safe and manage their inboxes more effectively.
