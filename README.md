## Business Use Case

Spam emails pose a constant threat to both individuals and businesses, from cluttering inboxes to enabling phishing attacks. Implementing a robust spam detection system not only ensures cleaner, more secure communication but also protects against potential security breaches and financial losses. This project highlights how a well-designed system can safeguard businesses and individuals from the growing menace of spam.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a practical and easy-to-integrate spam detection system that can be customized for different needs. Using the Naive Bayes algorithm and Python, the system will sort emails into "spam" or "ham" (non-spam), helping users stay safe and manage their inboxes more effectively.
